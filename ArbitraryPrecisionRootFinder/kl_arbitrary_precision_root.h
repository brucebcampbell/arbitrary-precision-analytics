/*
These functions all perform iterative root finding using derivatives: 

newton_raphson_iterateperforms second order Newton-Raphson iteration, 
halley_iterate andschroeder_iterate perform third order Halley and Schroeder iteration. 
The functions all take the same parameters: 

Parameters of the root finding functions

F f 
Type F must be a callable function object that accepts one parameter and returns a boost::math::tuple: 

For the second order iterative methods (Newton Raphson) the boost::math::tuple should have two elements containing the evaluation of the function and its first derivative. 

For the third order methods (Halley and Schroeder) the boost::math::tuple should have three elements containing the evaluation of the function and its first and second derivatives. 

T guess 
The initial starting value. A good guess is crucial to quick convergence! 

T min 
The minimum possible value for the result, this is used as an initial lower bracket. 

T max 
The maximum possible value for the result, this is used as an initial upper bracket. 

int digits 
The desired number of binary digits. 

uintmax_t max_iter 
An optional maximum number of iterations to perform. 

When using these functions you should note that: 

Default max_iter = (std::numeric_limits<boost::uintmax_t>::max)() is effectively 'iterate for ever'!. 
They may be very sensitive to the initial guess, typically they converge very rapidly if the initial guess has 
two or three decimal digits correct. However convergence can be no better than bisection, or in some rare cases, 
even worse than bisection if the initial guess is a long way from the correct value and the derivatives are close to zero. 
These functions include special cases to handle zero first (and second where appropriate) derivatives, and fall back to 
bisection in this case. However, it is helpful if functor F is defined to return an arbitrarily small value of the correct
sign rather than zero. 
If the derivative at the current best guess for the result is infinite (or very close to being infinite) then these functions 
may terminate prematurely. A large first derivative leads to a very small next step, triggering the termination condition. 
Derivative based iteration may not be appropriate in such cases. 
If the function is 'Really Well Behaved' (monotonic and has only one root) the bracket bounds min and max may as well be set
to the widest limits like zero and numeric_limits<T>::max(). 
But if the function more complex and may have more than one root or a pole, the choice of bounds is protection against 
jumping out to seek the 'wrong' root. 
These functions fall back to bisection if the next computed step would take the next value out of bounds. The bounds are
updated after each step to ensure this leads to convergence. However, a good initial guess backed up by asymptotically-tight
bounds will improve performance no end - rather than relying on bisection. 
The value of digits is crucial to good performance of these functions, if it is set too high then at best you will get one
extra (unnecessary) iteration, and at worst the last few steps will proceed by bisection. Remember that the returned value can
never be more accurate than f(x) can be evaluated, and that if f(x) suffers from cancellation errors as it tends to zero then
the computed steps will be effectively random. The value of digits should be set so that iteration terminates before this 
point: remember that for second and third order methods the number of correct digits in the result is increasing quite 
substantially with each iteration, digits should be set by experiment so that the final iteration just takes the next 
value into the zone where f(x) becomes inaccurate. 
To get the binary digits of accuracy, use policies::get_max_root_iterations<Policy>()). 
If you need some diagnostic output to see what is going on, you can #define BOOST_MATH_INSTRUMENT before the 
#include <boost/math/tools/roots.hpp>, and also ensure that display of all the possibly significant digits with 
cout.precision(std::numeric_limits<double>::max_digits10): but be warned, this may produce copious output! 
Finally: you may well be able to do better than these functions by hand-coding the heuristics used so that they 
are tailored to a specific function. You may also be able to compute the ratio of derivatives used by these methods 
more efficiently than computing the derivatives themselves. As ever, algebraic simplification can be a big win. 

Newton Raphson Method 
Given an initial guess x0 the subsequent values are computed using: 
x_{n+1} = x{n}- \frac{f(x)}{f'(x)}

Out of bounds steps revert to bisection of the current bounds. 

Under ideal conditions, the number of correct digits doubles with each iteration. 

Halley's Method 
Given an initial guess x0 the subsequent values are computed using: 
x_{n+1} = x{n}- \frac{2f(x)*f'(x)}{2(f'(x))^2 - f(x)*f''(x)} 

Over-compensation by the second derivative (one which would proceed in the wrong direction) causes the method to revert to a Newton-Raphson step. 

Out of bounds steps revert to bisection of the current bounds. 

Under ideal conditions, the number of correct digits trebles with each iteration. 

Schroeder's Method 
Given an initial guess x0 the subsequent values are computed using: 
x_{n+1} = x{n}- \frac{f(x)}{f'(x)} - \frac{f''(x)(f(x))^2}{2(f'(x))^3}
 
Over-compensation by the second derivative (one which would proceed in the wrong direction) causes the method to revert to a Newton-Raphson step. Likewise a Newton step is used whenever that Newton step would change the next value by more than 10%. 

Out of bounds steps revert to bisection of the current bounds. 

Under ideal conditions, the number of correct digits trebles with each iteration. 

Example 
Let's suppose we want to find the cube root of a number: the equation we want to solve along with its derivatives are: 
f(x) = x^3-a
f'(x) = 3x^2;
f''(x)=6x;
 

To begin with lets solve the problem using Newton-Raphson iterations, we'll begin by defining a function object 
(functor) that returns the evaluation of the function to solve, along with its first derivative f'(x): 
The code below is for Newton-Rhaphson

template <class T>
struct cbrt_functor
{
   cbrt_functor(T const& target) : a(target)
   { // Constructor stores value to be 'cube-rooted'.
   }
   boost::math::tuple<T, T> operator()(T const& z)
   { // z is estimate so far.
      return boost::math::make_tuple(
      z*z*z - a, // return both f(x)
      3 * z*z);  // and f'(x)
   }
private:
   T a; // to be 'cube-rooted'.
};

template <class T>T cbrt(T z){
   using namespace std; // for frexp, ldexp, numeric_limits.
   using namespace boost::math::tools;   int exp;
   frexp(z, &exp); // Get exponent of z (ignore mantissa).
   T min = ldexp(0.5, exp/3);   T max = ldexp(2.0, exp/3);
   T guess = ldexp(1.0, exp/3); // Rough guess is to divide the exponent by three.
   int digits = std::numeric_limits<T>::digits; // Maximum possible binary digits accuracy for type T.
   return newton_raphson_iterate(detail::cbrt_functor<T>(z), guess, min, max, digits);
}

The implementation below in this header uses Halley's method.
